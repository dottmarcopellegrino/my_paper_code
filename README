# ESG Funds in Europe: Code and Data Replication

This repository contains the complete Python code and supporting materials used to generate the results in the research paper:

**"ESG Funds in Europe: Performance, Structural Patterns, and Predictability in High-Dimensional Financial Data"**  
*Marco Pellegrino, 2025*

## 📄 Paper Abstract

The study investigates whether European ESG funds systematically differ from non-ESG funds in terms of risk-adjusted performance, latent structural patterns, and predictability from financial fundamentals. Leveraging a large-scale, cross-sectional dataset of over 67,000 mutual funds and ETFs (as of December 2023), the analysis combines econometric models with machine learning techniques—including PCA, t-SNE, K-Means clustering, and logistic regression. The findings show that ESG funds exhibit modestly higher Sharpe ratios, partial clustering under non-linear projections, and moderate predictability (~64%) of ESG status based on financial features.

## ⚙️ Requirements

The code was written in **Python 3.9+**, using the following main packages:

- `pandas`, `numpy`
- `scikit-learn` (PCA, t-SNE, logistic regression, clustering)
- `statsmodels` (OLS regression)
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` (plots)

Install all dependencies via:

pip install -r requirements.txt


🚀 How to Run
To reproduce the main results and figures:



python esg_analysis_script.py
Make sure the datasets (risultati_fondi_etf_morningstar_completi.csv, df_analysis_output.csv, etc.) are placed inside the /data/ folder.

🧠 Methods Summary
The analysis pipeline includes:

Descriptive analysis (returns, volatility, Sharpe ratios)

OLS regression with robust standard errors

Dimensionality reduction: PCA and t-SNE

K-Means clustering

Logistic classification of ESG status

All procedures are fully reproducible from a single script.

📊 Data Notes
The dataset includes over 67,000 European mutual funds and ETFs as of December 2023, retrieved from Morningstar.
ESG classification is based on Morningstar sustainability labels (Globe Rating, ESG Mandate, Low Carbon badges).
Raw Morningstar data is not shared due to licensing restrictions. However, pre-processed analytical outputs (without proprietary identifiers) are included in the /data folder.
